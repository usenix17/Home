&lt;p&gt;USI 
is committed to taking appropriate measures to ensure the safety and 
well-being of children [under Indiana law, a child is anyone who is &lt;b&gt;not yet 18&lt;/b&gt; years of age] participating in university-related activities.  
The University of Southern Indiana's Child Protection Policy is in 
place to support this effort.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this training course is to help 
university employees, volunteers, and university-affiliated organizations 
become familiar with the rules and regulations outlined in this policy.  
This policy supplements and does not supersede any other legal requirements, 
for example, child care or teacher licensure.  &lt;/p&gt;
