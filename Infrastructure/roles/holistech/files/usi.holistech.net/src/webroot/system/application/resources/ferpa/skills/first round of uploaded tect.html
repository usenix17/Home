2 – Student Rights</H3>
<UL>
PAGE:   <B>Who Does FERPA Protect?</B></P>
	<LI><P>In
	higher education (postsecondary school),
	FERPA protects eligible students (a student
	who has reached 18 years of age OR is attending a postsecondary
	institution) 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Campus
	Clue – Under FERPA,
	your institution can determine when rights begin for their new and
	incoming students (i.e. first day of class, admission, etc.). 
	However, student status cannot begin any later than the first day of
	classes.</P>
	<LI><P>Page

<UL>
	<LI><P>Page
	title:  <B>Right
	to Inspect and Review</B></P>
	<LI><P>
	Students
	have the right to:</P>
	<LI><P>inspect
	and review education
	records (Any
	record which contains info that is personally identifiable to a
	student AND is maintained by the university.  Discussed in detail in
	Module 4.)</P>
	<LI><P>
	be
	informed of the procedure for HOW to inspect and review their
	education records. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>
	Campus
	Clue – The student should submit official written requests to the
	appropriate office in order to review her records.  Also, schools
	often require the student to identify which records are being
	requested for inspection. Request for access must be granted by your
	institution no more than 45 days of the request.</P>
	<LI><P>Page
	title:  <B>Inaccessible

	Requiring

	<LI><P>
	Holding
	transcripts until an outstanding financial obligation is paid</P>
	<LI><P>
	Campus
	Clue - Even though your school cannot withhold transcripts, it is
	not required to provide students with copies of records (including
	transcripts), unless it's the only means for the student to inspect
	the record.  In these cases, the institution may include a watermark
	across the document stating "outstanding financial obligation
	exists," for example.</P>
	<LI><P>Page
	title: <B>Right
	to Seek to Amend</B></P>
	<LI><P>
	Students

	</P>
	<LI><P>
	seek
	amendment to education records believed to be inaccurate or
	misleading</P>
	<LI><P>
	be
	informed of the procedure for amending education records</P>
	<LI><P>
	Students
	should submit a written statement detailing objections</P>
	<LI><P>
	Campus
	Clue – Your school is permitted by FERPA to determine appropriate
	processing time to respond to amendment requests.  However, FERPA
	does acknowledge that this be "within  a reasonable time."</P>
	<LI><P>Page
	title:  <B>Appeal

	<LI><P>
	If
	the outcome of the hearing is unfavorable to student, the contested
	part of the record must be maintained and disclosed along with the
	record for as long as the record is kept. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>
	Campus
	Clue – Institutions should never keep anonymous records that make
	it impossible to trace the source and therefore amend a student's
	record.</P>
	<LI><P>Page

	Records That Cannot be Amended</B></P>

	<LI><P>
	Grades
	
	</P>
	<LI><P>

	Clue – FERPA does not dictate guidelines for handling amendments

	<LI><P>Page
	title:  <B>Right
	over Disclosure</B>
	
	</P>
	<LI><P>
	Campus
	Clue – Be careful when listing names of students and posting group
	photos.  A student may have requested disclosure restrictions.  A
	good practice, is when in doubt about releasing information, ask for
	prior written consent</P>
	<LI><P>Students
	have some control over disclosure

	of personally

	<LI><P>Although
	parents often play a supportive role in students' lives, once a

	postsecondary institution), rights
	under FERPA transfer to the student 
	
	</P>
	<LI><P>
	Regardless
	of who pays tuition costs, parents DO NOT have rights to students'
	education records in the college setting.</P>
	<LI><P>Campus
	Clue – In cases of students under 18 attending your school, always
	refer the parents to the high school for information regarding their
	child's education record.  Colleges can often share information with
	the high school regarding students' records as long as its based on
	legitimate educational interest.  Under FERPA, the high school can
