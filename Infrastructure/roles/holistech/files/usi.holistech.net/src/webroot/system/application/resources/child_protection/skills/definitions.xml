	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorized adult&lt;/strong&gt;: University employees who are at least eighteen years of age and who are assigned to teach or otherwise perform work in a program as part of their official job duties, or a representative of a group that has obtained permission to use campus facilities from a University department or employee authorized to grant such permission.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;University Sponsored Program: &lt;/strong&gt;The term “University sponsored program” includes ongoing or planned events that are designed by the University to include children such as camps, lessons, workshops, clubs, teams, projects, practices, tours, or open-houses.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The term “program” does not include: 1) Single performances or events open to the general public that are not targeted toward children (such as varsity athletic competitions, plays, concerts). 2) Regularly scheduled classes or activities designed primarily for enrolled students who are age 17 and above. 3) The placement of students, for academic credit and/or clinical or student teaching requirements, with external entities. Rather, when schools and/or departments place students at external entities for such purposes, students must be informed of their obligation to comply with the external entity’s own policies and procedures, including those regarding background checks and working with children.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	NOTE: This definition may not capture every circumstance in which minors are present on campus, and the application of this policy may depend upon the facts in a particular circumstance.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Child/minor: &lt;/strong&gt;A &quot;child&quot; under this definition generally means a person who is younger than age 18 or who is not an emancipated minor.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Child abuse: &lt;/strong&gt;Serious physical, emotional, or verbal mistreatment of a child, and/or engaging in sexual activity with a child. Included are one or more physical acts which cause serious physical injury to a child; acts likely to result in the emotional trauma of a child; verbal threats of physical violence; and any behavior which results in touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of a child for the purpose of sexual gratification of the child and/or adult, including touching by the child and/or adult with or without clothing.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inappropriate conduct: &lt;/strong&gt;Actions or omissions which do not rise to the level of child abuse, but are otherwise prohibited under this Policy (see conduct requirements).&lt;/li&gt;
