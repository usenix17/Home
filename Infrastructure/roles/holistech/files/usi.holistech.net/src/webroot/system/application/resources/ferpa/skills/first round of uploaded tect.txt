Module 1 – What is FERPA & Who Must Comply
Page title:  Information in the Modern Age 
In order to conduct daily business, schools must record and maintain a great deal of information about students.  With modern sophisticated technologies, this information can be extremely sensitive and the potential for misuse, whether unintentional or criminal, exists as never before.  
Page title: Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act 
FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) is a federal act intended to protect the privacy and accuracy of student records.
Consider the student as the “owner” and the institution as the “custodian”
Image:  
Page title: Who Must Comply?
“Do I really need to know about FERPA?  Isn't it mainly a concern for the registrar and other records offices?”
Note: put text in a thought bubble of an image of an inquisitive person 
Page title:  Who Must Comply?
ANY institution receiving federal funding (e.g. pell grants, financial aid, loan programs)
EVERY department throughout the institution, not merely records offices
EVERYONE on campus who has access to student information 
Note:  scatter the following words (make into an image via Word or something)
advisors, academic dept personnel, admissions, alumni offices, archivists, athletic coaches, activity coordinators, counselors, telephone operators, safety officers, financial accounting staff, deans, faculty, tour guides, housing directors, IT, librarians, registrar, secretaries, teaching assistants, etc. 
Page title:  The “FERPA Police” 
The Dept. of Education's FPCO (Family Policy Compliance Office – include address) enforces the act.
The FPCO issues a formal notice when a violation is reported.
Campus Clue – If a violation occurs at your school, the FPCO allows a reasonable amount of time to correct the situation and return to compliance. 
 Page title: Penalties for Non-Compliance
Noncompliance in ANY department can mean a loss of federal funding for the ENTIRE institution!
Having a firm understanding of FERPA's definitions, provisions, and scope of liability will guide you in your day-to-day decisions and in extenuating circumstances. 
Compliance Quiz
Module 2 – Student Rights
Page title:  Who Does FERPA Protect?
In higher education (postsecondary school), FERPA protects eligible students (a student who has reached 18 years of age OR is attending a postsecondary institution) 
Campus Clue – Under FERPA, your institution can determine when rights begin for their new and incoming students (i.e. first day of class, admission, etc.).  However, student status cannot begin any later than the first day of classes.
Page title:  Guaranteed Rights
Under FERPA, students have four guaranteed rights regarding education records.
1. Right to Inspect and Review
2. Right to Seek to Amend
3. Right Over Disclosure 
4. Right to File a Complaint 
Page title:  Right to Inspect and Review
Students have the right to:
inspect and review education records (Any record which contains info that is personally identifiable to a student AND is maintained by the university.  Discussed in detail in Module 4.)
be informed of the procedure for HOW to inspect and review their education records. 
Campus Clue – The student should submit official written requests to the appropriate office in order to review her records.  Also, schools often require the student to identify which records are being requested for inspection. Request for access must be granted by your institution no more than 45 days of the request.
Page title:  Inaccessible Information 
Students CANNOT review the following information which may be part of their records
information about other students
financial records of parents
confidential letters of recommendation (letters that the student has waived his right to inspect and are related to admission, application for employment, or honorary recognition) 
Page title: Withholding Students' Rights to Inspect Records
Schools are not allowed to withhold students' rights to inspect records
NOT permitted under FERPA 
Requiring search and retrieval fees
Holding transcripts until an outstanding financial obligation is paid
Campus Clue - Even though your school cannot withhold transcripts, it is not required to provide students with copies of records (including transcripts), unless it's the only means for the student to inspect the record.  In these cases, the institution may include a watermark across the document stating “outstanding financial obligation exists,” for example.
Page title: Right to Seek to Amend
Students have the right to 
seek amendment to education records believed to be inaccurate or misleading
be informed of the procedure for amending education records
Students should submit a written statement detailing objections
Campus Clue – Your school is permitted by FERPA to determine appropriate processing time to respond to amendment requests.  However, FERPA does acknowledge that this be “within  a reasonable time.”
Page title:  Appeal Process
Student must be 
given the opportunity for a formal hearing AND
be advised of the appeal process 
Hearing requirements:
held within reasonable amount of time
give notice of date, time, and place
conducted by someone who doesn't have direct interest in the outcome
give fair opportunity to provide evidence
provide decisions in writing that include a summary of evidence and reasons for decision
If the outcome of the hearing is unfavorable to student, the contested part of the record must be maintained and disclosed along with the record for as long as the record is kept. 
Campus Clue – Institutions should never keep anonymous records that make it impossible to trace the source and therefore amend a student's record.
Page title:  Records That Cannot be Amended
Certain aspects of a student's record cannot be amended
Records not created by the school (transferred from another identity and are now part of the education record)
objections must be directed toward the source of the records
Grades 
Campus Clue – FERPA does not dictate guidelines for handling amendments to grades. Your school should establish its own policy to deal with grade disputes 
Page title:  Right over Disclosure 
Campus Clue – Be careful when listing names of students and posting group photos.  A student may have requested disclosure restrictions.  A good practice, is when in doubt about releasing information, ask for prior written consent
Students have some control over disclosure (to make known, reveal, or share) of personally identifiable information (the kind of information or data from which the identity of a specific person can be determined.  For example, student's name, place of birth, or SSN.  This concept is discussed in detail in Module 4) from their records
must provide a written request to restrict disclosure 
students can request the following be withheld:
1. Directory information (Information contained in an education record that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed, such as name, phone number, or email address.  The sharing of this information is generally considered to help the community function more efficiently. Discussed in detail in Module 5)
2. ALL information regarding the student.  This is sometimes referred to as a “FERPA Restriction” (These are very rare student requests and require counseling and extenuating circumstances, such as being in the witness protection program, a celebrity, or stalking victim. If a student is requesting this type of restriction, the school cannot even acknowledge his existence when inquired). 

Page title:  Right to File a Complaint 
Students have the right to file a complaint concerning alleged compliance failures and must be:
submitted in writing to the FPCO office (see address in resources located in the side bar of the course - Family Policy Compliance Office, US Dept. of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20202-5920)
contain specific allegations of fact and provide reasonable cause to believe that a violation has occurred
Compliance Quiz
Module 3 – Parents
Page title:  Transfer of Rights
Although parents often play a supportive role in students' lives, once a student is considered an eligible student (a student who has reached 18 years of age OR is attending a postsecondary institution), rights under FERPA transfer to the student  
Regardless of who pays tuition costs, parents DO NOT have rights to students' education records in the college setting.
Campus Clue – In cases of students under 18 attending your school, always refer the parents to the high school for information regarding their child's education record.  Colleges can often share information with the high school regarding students' records as long as its based on legitimate educational interest.  Under FERPA, the high school can share that information with the parent.       
Page title:  FERPA Exceptions Regarding Parents
FERPA allows institutions to the option to provide parents personally identifiable information in the following cases 
parents of dependent children for income tax purposes
health and safety emergencies (if information is necessary to protect the health and safety of the student or others)
notification of drug and alcohol violations as long as the student:
was found guilty AND
under 21
Compliance Quiz 
Module 4 – Education Records
Page title: Defining Education Records
Any record which contains “personally identifiable information” of a student AND is maintained by an educational institution or by a party acting for the institution.
Page title: Personally Identifiable Information
the kind of information or data from which the identity of a specific person can be determined.  For example:
student’s name
parent or family member’s name
student or student’s family’s address
ssn
student number
biometric record (dna, fingerprints, ocular, voice recognition)
date of birth
place of birth
mother’s maiden name

Page title - Excluded from Education Records 
The following are NOT considered Education Records and are therefore NOT subject to the privacy protections of FERPA
Sole Possession Records
Law Enforcement Records
Employment Records
Medical / Treatment Records
Alumni Records
Unrecorded Grades 
Page title: Sole Possession Records
Records that remain in the sole possession (Shared with no one.  Only viewable to the one who created the record) of the maker
Can NEVER be shared with anyone except a temporary substitute (someone who temporarily takes the place of the person who created the record.  This is not the same thing as sharing records with other faculty)
Once shared, they become part of the student's education record. 
Campus Clue – Members of the college community may create their own, private notes about their students to help them assign grades or helping them to remember details, for example.  
Page title: Law Enforcement Records
records maintained and stored by law enforcement (any law enforcement unit or campus security) for law enforcement purposes
law enforcement may refuse to allow access to and disclose these records without students' consent 
Campus Clue:  If your school shares part of a student's record with the law enforcement unit, that record is still considered an “education record” and therefore proected under FERPA.    
Page title: Employment Records
records relating to employees of the institution 
if the employee is required to be a student (work-study programs, for example) for employment, these records WOULD be considered education records protected under FERPA
Page title: Medical / Treatment Records
records relating to medical treatment provided by a recognized professional (physician, psychiatrist, or other professional) 
If these records are disclosed for reasons other than treatment, they are now “education records” subject to FERPA
Page title: Alumni Records
records CREATED AFTER student has graduated
if these records relate to when a person was a student, they would then be covered under FERPA 
Page title: Unrecorded Grades
grades on peer-graded assignments BEFORE they are collected and recorded by the teacher
once the grades have been recorded and maintained by the instructor, these records become part of the student's education record.
“Campus Clue” - Instructors are allowed to have students grade each other's work and publicly announce the student's grade for the instructor to record since at the time of the vocalization, the grades we not considered education records.  
Case Study – Supreme Court decision page 43

Module 5 – Types of Information
Page title – Classifying Types of Information
As you learned in the previous Module, education records are records that contain personally identifiable information (the kind of information or data from which the identity of a specific person can be determined.  For example, student's name, place of birth, or SSN).  
FERPA classifies this information into two categories:
Directory Information
Non-Directory Information
Page title – Directory Information
Information contained in an education record that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed
This type of information is usually intended to help the campus community thrive. 
Page title – Each School Decides
FERPA provides a list of items that may be included in directory information (Information contained in an education record that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed.  The following MAY NOT be included: 
student ID number (explanation of student id number weirdness)
ssn

FERPA leaves the final decision to each educational institution as to what information will be made publicly available.
What the institution decides to classify as directory information must be published in its annual notification (a required notification published on an annual basis by the institution that notifies students of their FERPA rights, how to exercise those rights, and what information it classifies as “directory information” which can be shared.  You will learn more about the annual notification in Module 7).   
Page title – What MAY Be Released
Information is  to be classified as “directory information” and can therefore be shared:
name
address, telephone listing
electronic mail address
student user ID (“an identifier used by students to access or communicate within the institutions computer systems.” - pg 47 -  only as long as this identifier alone cannot be used to access education records)
photograph
date/place of birth
major field of study
grade level
enrollment status
dates of attendance (means period of time, not specific daily attendance)
degrees, honors, and awards
most recent ed institution attended
participation in recognized activities and sports
weight and height of members of athletic teams

Page title – Non-Directory Information 
Comprised of everything else that is contained in student records including:
grades
transcripts
declarations
correspondence
reports

Module 6 – Consent
Page title – Prior Written Consent
authorization by eligible student to allow the institution to disclose personally identifiable information from education records
required components of the consent:
specify which records may be disclosed
state the purpose of the disclosure
identy the party to whom the disclosure be made
student signature
dated
Page title – When is Consent Not Required?
The following are examples of instances when the institution does not need prior written consent to disclose records
Legitimate educational interest
audit or evaluation of compliance with ed programs
connection with financial aid
to organizations conducting studies to improve instruction
accrediting organizations
parents of dependent students
judicial order or subpoena
health/safety emergency
directory info (unless “no release”)
releasing results of disciplinary hearing to a victim of crime
Page Title – Legitimate Educational Interest
Can you image if every piece of information about a student were kept secret?  It would be nearly impossible for the college community to function.
Consent is not required in cases of a school official (any employee who has responsibilities for the creation, maintenance, and disclosure of information from education records (teachers, administrators, advisors, etc.) in order to perform his official, educationally-related duties
Access to records must be justifiable.  Curiosity doesn't count!   
Campus Clue – FERPA gives your school permission to define the term “school official,” but requires that it publish this definition in its annual notification.
Case Study - the outsourcing of institutional functions (to third parties - other than the student and institution) has never been prevented by FERPA.  For example, higher education service providers assist colleges in a variety of tasks, including enrollment, degree verification, payments and collections, fundraising, alumni relationship management, and police and security services - pg 59
these outside entities who function as education officials for an institution must comply with FERPA to the same degree that other education official on the campus must adhere to the regulations.
Educational institutions are responsible for their outside service providers’ failure to comply
it’s important for the institution to have written agreements that comprehensively communicate the parameters of the service providers’ use of information from ed records. 
Module 7 – FERPA in the College Setting
Page title - Understand Your School's Policies
FERPA is a statute on privacy.  It is not intended to define higher education policy or hinder pedagogy or educational business.  While the act contains certain requirements, it leaves much to the institutions.
It's not enough to understand the general guidelines outlines in FERPA, it's important to know your school's policies and definitions
Campus Clue – If you're taking this course, chances are you have access to student records.  Applying FERPA knowledge is not just the job of specific records departments, it's your job as well.)
Page title – Responsibilities of the Institution 
Maintain practices to ensure privacy of students' records   
Define terms that affect local practice and FERPA compliance
Publish an annual notification informing students of these definitions and their privacy rights under FERPA
Page title – Annual Notification
Institutions must publish the following information annually
The four primary guarantees given to students under FERPA as well as the procedure for exercising those rights.
1. Right to Inspect and Review
2. Right to Seek to Amend
3. Right over Disclosure 
4. Right to File a Complaint 
Definitions such as 
School official
Legitimate educational interest
Disclosure of policies and practices of sharing and utilizing student information including what the school classifies as “directory information.”
The notification must 
be easily accessible (reasonally available to the student population.  In a catalog or student handbook, for example).
Effectively notify (make reasonable accommodations to inform) students who are disabled
